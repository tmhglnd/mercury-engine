# üåï Mercury Engine

**The engine (core) of the Mercury Live Coding Environment for the browser**

This Package does not include the browser editor and user interface. This package allows you to include the Mercury webaudio engine into your own web projects and generate sound from the Mercury code. This engine is used in the [Mercury-Playground](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground), a browser based version of the environment.

Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground)
* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury)

# üöÄ Install

## Install in node_modules

```
$ npm install mercury-engine
```

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

## Include in html

Include latest or a specific version of distribution (minified, es5) through url in script index.html 

Recommended for most cases:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Other options:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Load the engine in the `<script>` code like so:

```js
const { Mercury } = MercuryEngine;

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

# Usage

### Include and initialize

Include the package

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');
```

Initialize the engine and include a callback function through { onload: }

```js
const Engine = Mercury({
	onload: () => {
		console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
	}
});
```

### Resume, evaluate and silence

Resume the transport and start the webaudio. This has to be done from a user interaction (click or keypress) to allow sound to play from the browser window.

```js
Engine.resume();
```

Evaluate a mercury code file by providing a string of code. This also resumes the transport if .resume() was not called yet.

```js
Engine.code(`
	set tempo 100
	new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
	new sample hat_909 time(1/4 1/8) gain(0.6)
	new synth saw note(0 0) time(1/16) shape(1 80)
`);
```

Stop the transport and silence the audio

```js
Engine.silence();
```

Return the last succesfully evaluated code. If code is evaluated that resulted in an error it is not stored.

```js
Engine.getCode();
```

### Recording

Start the recording of the sound

```js
Engine.record(true);
```

Returns 'started' if the recording is on

```js
Engine.isRecording();
```

Stop the recording and download the file `myRecording.webm`

```js
Engine.record(false, 'myRecording');
```

### Settings

Set the BPM without using `set tempo` in the Mercury code

```js
Engine.setBPM(140);
```

Set a randomized BPM

```js
Engine.randomBPM();
```

Set the volume without using `set volume` in the Mercury code. Volume in floating amplitude 0 to 1.

```js
Engine.setVolume(0.5);
```

Set the crossFade between 2 code evaluations without using `set crossFade` in the Mercury code. Time in milliseconds.

```js
Engine.setCrossFade(500);
```

Set the HighPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set highPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setHighPass(400);
```

Set the LowPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set lowPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setLowPass(5000);
```

Get the value for any of the settings

```js
console.log(Engine.bpm);
console.log(Engine.volume);
console.log(Engine.crossFade);
console.log(Engine.highPass);
console.log(Engine.lowPass);
```

### Samples

Add your own samples from for example a url like raw github or freesound. The url can also contain a .json file that references multiple samples and the sample name.

```js
Engine.addBuffers();
```

Get the content of all the loaded Buffers, this is returned as a ToneAudioBuffers class

```js
Engine.getBuffers();
```

### Customized log function

Replace the log() function in the engine for a custom log fuction to for example display errors in HTML elements

```js
Engine.log = (print) => {
	let p = JSON.stringify(print).replace(/\,/g, ' ').replace(/\"/g, '');
	document.getElementById('log-div').innerHTML += `${p}<br>`;
}
```

## üìã To Do

- [ ] Include OSC communcation options via socket.io
- [ ] Use engine in the Mercury-playground instead of the other code-base
- [ ] Allow control of parameters via DOM elements

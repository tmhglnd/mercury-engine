# üåï Mercury Engine

**The engine (core) of the Mercury Live Coding Environment for the browser**

This Package does not include the browser editor and user interface. This package allows you to include the Mercury webaudio engine into your own web projects and generate sound from the Mercury code. This engine is used in the [Mercury-Playground](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground), a browser based version of the environment.

Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground)
* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury)

# üöÄ Install

## Install in node_modules

```
$ npm install mercury-engine
```

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

## Include in html

Include latest or a specific version of distribution (minified, es5) through url in script index.html 

Recommended for most cases:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Other options:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine/dist/mercury.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/dist/mercury.min.es5.js"></script>
```

Load the engine in the `<script>` code like so:

```js
const { Mercury } = MercuryEngine;

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

## Examples

See the `examples` folder for a few `.html` files that demonstrate the usage. Run them locally by cloning this repository with `git clone https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-engine`. Then `cd mercury-engine` and run a simple http-server, for example with the `http-server` node package (install globally with `npm i -g http-server`). Navigate to `localhost:8080/examples` and try them out.

# Usage

### Include and initialize

Include the package

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');
```

Initialize the engine and include a callback function through { onload: }, this will be executed when samples are loaded.

```js
const Engine = Mercury({
	onload: () => {
		console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
		console.log('The loaded samples:', Engine.getBuffers());
	}
});
```

### Resume, evaluate and silence

Resume the transport and start the webaudio. This has to be done from a user interaction (click or keypress) to allow sound to play from the browser window.

```js
Engine.resume();
```

Evaluate a mercury code file by providing a string of code. This also resumes the transport if .resume() was not called yet.

```js
Engine.code(`
	set tempo 100
	new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
	new sample hat_909 time(1/4 1/8) gain(0.6)
	new synth saw note(0 0) time(1/16) shape(1 80)
`);
```

Stop the transport and silence the audio

```js
Engine.silence();
```

Return the last succesfully evaluated code. If code is evaluated that resulted in an error it is not stored.

```js
Engine.getCode();
```

### Samples

Add your own samples from for example a url like raw github or freesound. The url can also contain a .json file that references multiple samples and the sample name.

```js
Engine.addBuffers(files, callback);
```

For example use a json file containing sample names and urls

```js
Engine.addBuffers('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmhglnd/mercury-engine/main/examples/samples/freesound-samples.json');
```

Or load samples directly by creating an array of urls

```js
let s1 = 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/671/671221_3797507-lq.mp3';
let s2 = 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/145/145778_2101444-lq.mp3';

Engine.addBuffers([s1, s2]);
```

Add a callback function, this is called when all samples are loaded

```js
Engine.addBuffers('https://someurl.json', () => {
	console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
	console.log('The loaded samples:', Engine.getBuffers());
});
```

Get the content of all the loaded Buffers, this is returned as a `ToneAudioBuffers` class

```js
Engine.getBuffers();
```

### Recording

Start the recording of the sound

```js
Engine.record(true);
```

Returns 'started' if the recording is on

```js
Engine.isRecording();
```

Stop the recording and download the file `myRecording.webm`

```js
Engine.record(false, 'myRecording');
```

### MIDI

WebMIDI is included and started if the browser is compatible with it. If not, an error will be printed to the console. You can provide a callback function `onmidi` to execute some code when the WebMIDI enabling was succesful.

```js
const Engine = Mercury({
	onmidi: () => {
		console.log('The WebMIDI status is:', Engine.midi.status);
		console.log('With inputs:', Engine.midi.inputs);
		console.log('And outputs:', Engine.midi.outputs);
	}
});
```

### Settings

Set the BPM without using `set tempo` in the Mercury code

```js
Engine.setBPM(140);
```

Set a randomized BPM

```js
Engine.randomBPM();
```

Set the volume without using `set volume` in the Mercury code. Volume in floating amplitude 0 to 1.

```js
Engine.setVolume(0.5);
```

Set the crossFade between 2 code evaluations without using `set crossFade` in the Mercury code. Time in milliseconds.

```js
Engine.setCrossFade(500);
```

Set the HighPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set highPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setHighPass(400);
```

Set the LowPass Filter cutoff frequency without using `set lowPass` in the Mercury code.

```js
Engine.setLowPass(5000);
```

Get the value for any of the settings

```js
console.log(Engine.bpm);
console.log(Engine.volume);
console.log(Engine.crossFade);
console.log(Engine.highPass);
console.log(Engine.lowPass);
```

### Log function listener

Logs that are important for the Mercury coder are also emitted as a custom event in the browser. You can create an event listener for `mercuryLog`. The `e.detail` contains the printed message. This can be used to for example print things to custom html elements instead of the javascript console.

```js
window.addEventListener('mercuryLog', (e) => {
	let p = JSON.stringify(e.detail).replace(/\,/g, ' ').replace(/\"/g, '');
	document.getElementById('logger').innerHTML += `${p}<br>`;
	console.log('customprint:', e.detail);
});
```

### DOM elements from P5js

It is possible to control parameters from instruments in the Mercury code by writing a string that contains `{}` with the js code inside to get the dom value. For example when using DOM elements from the P5js library, such as sliders, they can be used in the code.

```js
let slider;

// p5js setup function
function setup() {
	noCanvas();
	// create a slider with range 50 - 5000, initial 1000
	slider = createSlider(50, 5000, 1000, 0);
}

// use the slider value as a cutoff frequency for the filter
Engine.code(`new synth saw note(0 0) fx(filter low '{slider.value()}' 0.4)`);
```

## üìã To Do

- [ ] Include OSC communcation options via socket.io

# üåï Mercury Engine

**The engine (core) of the Mercury Live Coding Environment for the browser**

This Package does not include the browser editor and user interface. This package allows you to include the Mercury webaudio engine into your own web projects and generate sound from the Mercury code. This engine is used in the [Mercury-Playground](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground), a browser based version of the environment.

Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground)
* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury)

# üöÄ Install

## Install in node_modules

```
$ npm install mercury-engine
```

```js
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

## Include in html

Include latest or specific version of bundled es5 version through url in index.html 

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mercury-engine@1.0.0/build/mercury.min.js"></script>
```

Use in a html `<script>` like so:

```js
const { Mercury } = MercuryEngine;

const Engine = new Mercury();
```

# Usage

```js
// include the package
const { Mercury } = require('mercury-engine');

// initialize the engine and included a callback function
const Engine = Mercury(() => {
	console.log('This callback is called when samples are loaded!');
});

// resume the transport and start the webaudio
// this has to be done from a user interaction (click/key) to allow sound
// to play from the browser window
Engine.resume()

// Evaluate a mercury code file by providing an object with {file:<code>}
// This also resumes the transport if .resume() was not called yet
Engine.code({ file: `
	set tempo 100
	new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
	new sample hat_909 time(1/4 1/8) gain(0.6)
	new synth saw note(0 0) time(1/16) shape(1 80)
`});

// stop the transport and silence the audio
Engine.silence();

// start the recording of the sound
Engine.record(true);

// returns 'started' if the recording is on
Engine.isRecording()

// stop the recording and download the file myRecording.webm
Engine.record(false, 'myRecording');

// set the BPM without adding `set tempo` to the Mercury code
Engine.setBPM(140);

// set the volume without adding `set volume` to the Mercury code
Engine.setVolume(0.5);

// add your own samples from for example a url like raw github or freesound
// the url can also contain a .json file that references multiple samples and 
// the sample name
Engine.addSamples();
```
